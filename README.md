CS 290 Final Project
Code and demo due by 5:00pm on Friday, 6/15/2018
In this course, a final programming project will take the place of formal exams to test your understanding of the material.  The final project will involve working with a team of 3-4 people to implement a substantial web app that utilizes all of the major components of the web application stack covered in this class.  Specifically, you and your teammates will write a web app that satisfies all of these requirements:

The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store, such as MongoDB.
The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.

Within those boundaries, your team may write any kind of web app you want.  There are infinite possibilities, and I encourage you to be creative and to implement an application you find interesting or that solves a real problem for some set of potential users.  Below are some guidelines and logistics for the final project.

Be realistic about your project
Importantly, you should also be realistic about what you can actually accomplish with a small team in a few weeks.  In particular, feel free to treat the final project as an opportunity to deliver a prototype, not a polished product.  If you’re having trouble thinking of an idea for an app to implement, please reach out to me, and I can help you figure something out.

One thing in particular you should be cautious of is implementing an app that requires user authentication and logged-in sessions.  Getting the details of these things right can be tricky, and I don’t want you to get bogged down in these details.  Implementing logins is not needed for the kind of prototype you’ll implement for this project.  If you do want to implement authentication and logged-in sessions, you must discuss with me to get approval.


Grading demonstrations
The grade for your project will include a brief (10-15 minute) demonstration to me (Hess) of your project’s functionality.  To get a grade for your project, your team must do a demo.  Demonstrations will be scheduled for finals week.  I’ll send more details on scheduling when we get closer to that time.
Code submission
All code for your final project must be pushed to the master branch of the repo created for your team using the GitHub Classroom link above before your grading demo.
Grading criteria
Your team’s grade (out of 100 points) for the final project will be based on successfully implementing a complete web app that satisfies these criteria:

The app uses HTML and CSS to implement a well-designed client interface.
The app uses client-side JS to enable relevant user interactions with the client interface.
The app is served using a Node.js-based (or other approved) serving stack.
The app dynamically generates pages based on data stored in a back end data store.
The app’s client interface communicates with the app’s server to create, read, update, and/or delete content in the back end data store.

Remember, if your team does not do a demo for your project, you will receive a zero for it.
Individual grades
Your individual grade for the project will be based on your team’s grade and also on evidence of your meaningful participation in your team’s work on the project, including from these sources:

The commit log of your GitHub repository.
Your presence at and participation in your team’s project demo.

In particular, if your GitHub commit log shows that you did not make meaningful contributions to your team’s implementation of your app and/or you do not participate in your team’s demonstration of your app (without explicit prior approval by me), you will receive a lower grade on the project than your teammates.  I may use other sources as evidence of your participation, as well.
